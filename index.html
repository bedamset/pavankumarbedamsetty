<div id="Profile" class="section fade-in">
    <h2>Profile Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I was born and raised in an environment where construction was not just a profession but a way of life. Observing construction sites, witnessing meticulous planning, collaboration among teams, and the transformation of raw materials into functional structures fascinated me from an early age. This exposure instilled a deep interest in the built environment and inspired me to pursue a career that combines creativity, technical expertise, and leadership.
    </p>
    <p>
        Driven by curiosity and an ever-learning mindset, I completed a B.Tech in Civil Engineering at Krishna Chaitanya Institute of Technology and Science, graduating First Class with Distinction. I gained a strong foundation in surveying, structural analysis, geotechnical engineering, environmental management, transportation engineering, construction materials, and project estimation. Hands-on experience in labs, field surveys, and construction projects honed my analytical and problem-solving abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        I pursued a Master’s in Construction Management with BIM at Coventry University, UK, graduating with Distinction. My master’s journey allowed me to dive deep into advanced construction management, sustainable design, BIM, energy-efficient construction, and integrated project delivery. My research project, “Addressing the Lack of Skilled Workers on Construction Sites in India,” applied mixed-methods research, thematic analysis, and statistical tools (SPSS, MS Forms) to investigate workforce gaps and propose practical solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alongside academics, I gained professional exposure at Amazon UK, strengthening leadership, mentoring, and operational skills by resolving workflow challenges, mentoring associates, and achieving operational excellence targets. These experiences shaped me into a versatile professional with a holistic understanding of construction, technology, workforce management, and business operations.
    </p>
    <p>
        My profile reflects a unique blend of construction expertise, BIM and sustainability knowledge, workforce and HR insight, logistics leadership, and advanced web development skills, equipping me to contribute to complex, interdisciplinary projects integrating technology, management, and sustainability.

        <div class="future-aspirations">
            <p>With a strong foundation in Construction Management, BIM, NDVI-based environmental assessment, and workforce research, I aspire to pursue a PhD that deepens my exploration into sustainable development, Net Zero construction, and human resource efficiency within the built environment and logistics sectors.</p>
            <p>Being practical, I recognise that research opportunities are not always easy to secure — therefore, I have consciously broadened my expertise beyond traditional construction disciplines. My goal is to create research that bridges industries, connecting sustainability, technology, NDVI and energy analysis, and human capital to drive long-term organisational and environmental improvement.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sustainable Construction & Net Zero:</strong> Applying NDVI and energy analysis to design carbon-neutral buildings, optimise site planning, and integrate circular economy principles.</li>

            <p><strong>Coventry University | MSc Construction Management with BIM | 2023</strong><br>
            Supervisor: Mr. Sanjeev Lehil</p>
            <p><em>“Addressing the lack of skilled workers on construction sites in India and proposing a strategic framework for bridging the divide.”</em></p>

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This postgraduate research investigated the national-scale challenge of skilled labour shortages in India’s construction sector — an industry contributing over £22 billion annually to the GDP and employing millions. The study identified root causes, assessed impacts on project performance, and proposed an evidence-based strategic framework to bridge the skills gap.</p>

            <h4>Methodology</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Mixed-methods approach under a pragmatic research philosophy</li>
                <li>Surveyed 85 construction professionals via Microsoft Forms</li>
                <li>IBM SPSS statistical analysis to identify frequency patterns & correlations</li>
                <li>Thematic analysis for qualitative insights into training, education, and technology adoption</li>
                <li>Developed the original “Convergence Model” for methodological reliability and data integration</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Findings</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>85% of construction firms reported skilled worker shortages affecting productivity, cost, and safety</li>
                <li>Training gaps, migration patterns, and limited adoption of digital tools (BIM, CSCS Cards) identified as primary causes</li>
                <li>Correlation established between skill deficits and project quality decline</li>
                <li>Proposed strategic workforce framework: continuous skill-assessment, industry-academia collaboration, youth apprenticeships, and technology-driven upskilling</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Results & Recognition</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Earned Distinction (73%) for research quality and practical relevance</li>
                <li>Framework considered as a model for training standardisation and workforce digitalisation in developing contexts</li>
